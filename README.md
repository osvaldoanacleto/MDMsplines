(now ancient) code developed for the work presented in the paper:

[Anacleto, O., Queen, C., & Albers, C. J. (2013). Forecasting multivariate road traffic flows using Bayesian dynamic graphical models, splines and other traffic variables. Australian & New Zealand Journal of Statistics, 55(2), 69-86.](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/anzs.12026)

Network data from Highways England are now freely available [here](http://tris.highwaysengland.co.uk/detail/trafficflowdata). At the time of my PhD, a written permission was required to access their data (which now seems to be no longer required). 

Please check the paper for details on the data used and node network terminology used in the code.
